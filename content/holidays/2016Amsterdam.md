Friday 22nd April
=
Set off at 12.30 to drive to Canterbury to stay overnight at The Millers Arms.
Accident en route so miles of tail back, my journey took over 5 hours instead of 2 1⁄2.
Finally arrived about an hour before Andrew who was travelling here by train after a days work in
London.

I checked in, had a walk by the river, then armed with a glass of red wine sat outside to await his
arrival. Had planned an afternoon of wandering around Canterbury – but hey ho that didn't happen
We ate at the pub as the menu looked great ­ nice dinner here, but we've had better in Canterbury.
Went for a walk after dinner & a drink in town then headed back for an early night as we are
driving to Amsterdam tomorrow.

Saturday 23rd April

Lovely full English breakfast about 7.30am this morning & off to Dover to catch the ferry.
Managed to get on the 10am crossing to Dunkirk, brilliant crossing – very windy but bright day.
2 hours on the ferry, then a 3 1⁄2 hour drive to Amsterdam.
We checked in to the Ink hotel, dumped the luggage & went straight out for a walk & to find
somewhere nice for a drink & relax after our journey.

At the Pancake House we had a lovely bacon, cheese & spinach pancake for lunch.
It's really really cold here, just like home Spring is still waiting to Sprung!!
Later we had a lovely dinner at St. George Argentijns Grill – calamari, steak & wine, all yummy.
Early to bed again as it's Keukenhof in the morning!!

Sunday 24th April

After a coffee we set off nice & early to the wonderful Keukenhof Gardens to wander around this
stunning place and to see the tulip fields of course – our main reason for this trip.
Just arrived when Andrew had to stop as he has stomachache. Thought I'd have to take him back to
the hotel, but eventually he recovered enough to continue, so we went for a cuppa & rested a bit
more.

Explored the whole garden, the inside orchid area and the tulip fields, this is one of the most
beautiful gardens I've even seen, stunning displays everywhere you look. I would recommend
anyone who loves flowers to visit, there are no words to adequately describe it.

Eventually, having seen everything, we set off back to Amsterdam, parked underground again &
went for a stroll around the shopping centre Plaza – used to be the post office, it's a fabulous old
building that looks like it should be a 5* hotel. Walked next down by the canal and had
a beer sitting outside a cafe, a sudden torrential downpour put an end to that idea!

Strolling on after the rain had stopped we inadvertently found the red light district & wandered
passed a few ladies of the night displaying themselves in the windows, several topless clubs, sex
museums etc etc.
Found the Grasshopper pub with outdoor seating surrounded by flowers & heaters and overlooking
the canal. We ordered a hot chocolate each, very disappointing instant watery thing, we were not
impressed!

Back at the hotel we freshened up & went back out to find some dinner. Strangely we found
Bagels Sandwich Village where we had excellent Tapas & a really good Rioja to go with it. Went
into a cafe for a drink on way back & had fabulous custard chocolate eclairs for pudding, they
really can do cakes over here. Had a bit of trouble getting Andrew back to the hotel room though!

Monday 25th April
=
Time to check out & it's the long drive back to Dunkirk, ferry back to Dover & the drive back
home from there!
Home to our gorgeous cats, who had definitely missed us, cuddles & fuss then off to Cafe Balti for
a curry & relax after the journey!
