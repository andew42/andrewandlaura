<h1 id="sun-14th-may">Sun 14th May</h1>

<p>We were at Nicks at 10.40am and set off to Southampton, stopping at the Bell Inn for Sunday roast. We then visited the Alms House and Hospital next door, it&rsquo;s a beautiful 14th century building with stunning gardens.We really enjoyed our wander around there en route.</p>

<p>Reached Southampton airport in plenty of time, flight left <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hour early due to heavy fog in the Channel Islands. The flight was fine, and the taxi we&rsquo;d booked eventually arrived to take us to Maison Bourgage for our first night in Alderney before booking in to Fort Clonque. We dropped off the luggage and went out to explore St. Annes town.We wandered down to the sea then up to Belle Vue hotel for a rather mediocre dinner.Back to the maison then for an early night.</p>

<h1 id="mon-15th-may">Mon 15th May</h1>

<p>Breakfasted on scrambled eggs on toast then checked out of the maison leaving our luggage to be collected at 3.30pm by the taxi &amp; transferred to Fort Clonque.</p>

<p>We walked through the woods up to Mount Albert and the German Fort to explore, where we saw the Cambridge Nutter&rsquo;s flight arriving, Andrew took some photos then we walked back down via the coast road to meet up with them.</p>

<p>We have Gav &amp; Louise, Jennifer &amp; Jenny, Dave, Rick, Phil, Matt, Jon &amp; Bernie joining us for our holiday in Fort Clonque. We met up first with Gav &amp; J squared who had already hired bicycles. We went for coffee then walked to Fort Tourgis to explore.</p>

<p>The whole gang met up at the Harbourside Cafe for lunch - wonderful lobster! Then it was time to go to Fort Clonque via maison to ensure transfer of luggage and meet Geoff the caretaker who would give us the tour of the fort and a potted history and hand over the keys for our stay there.</p>

<p>I had sorted out and ordered a shopping list to be delivered to the fort for our stay as recommended by Geoff when we arranged the holiday and it had all arrived ready for us! So beer &amp; wine already on tap we sorted bedrooms, settled in, then went outside to watch the sunset, and the tide coming in to cover the causeway leading to the fort - thats us effectively on an island till the tide goes back out! This was something we were aware we needed to keep an eye on, we have to check the tides in case we get stuck on the other side of the causeway and end up with no bed for the night after an evening in the pub.</p>

<h1 id="tue-16th-may">Tue 16th May</h1>

<p>Up with the lark at 5am, bad tummy due to being stupid and eating lobster and dreadful backache.</p>

<p>Andrew and I have our own little en suite here, courtesy of making all the arrangements. Torrential rain so we sat around and read till it cleared then went for a walk around the coast road which winds up giving an excellent view of the fort and some large rocks which are home to hundreds of Gannets. We continued walking and found some Standing Stones then eventually made our way down to St. Annes. We stopped for coffee then wandered around the shops until the rest of the Nutter&rsquo;s found us and we went to Bumps restaurant for a lovely evening meal accompanied by plenty of beer and wine. We then got a taxi back to the fort and it was time for bed.</p>

<h1 id="wed-17th-may">Wed 17th May</h1>

<p>Up at 7.30am and more rain has arrived, I had a lazy day today, dozing &amp; reading as back still not back to normal.</p>

<p>Andrew went out with some of the others to explore for the day. There are so many old forts and buildings here, and the scenery is lovely. St. Annes is about a two mile walk from the fort and is the largest town on the island.</p>

<p>Jenny cooked a curry with cherry pie and custard to follow for dinner this evening. Lazy evening at the fort for all of us, drinking wine and playing games or reading. I love these Landmark holidays with no television or other media and time to just relax and do your own thing.</p>

<h1 id="thu-18th-may">Thu 18th May</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s our last day at Fort Clonque already so time to pack and leave this amazing Landmark Trust building.</p>

<p>We went for a lovely walk by the sea in the sun and sat on the shore for ages watching the waves and taking photos. Then into St. Annes and wandered around, lunched at the Georgian House then it was time for the flight back home.</p>
