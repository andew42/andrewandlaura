<h1 id="friday-22nd-april">Friday 22nd April</h1>

<p>Set off at 12.30 to drive to Canterbury to stay overnight at The Millers Arms.
Accident en route so miles of tail back, my journey took over 5 hours instead of 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.
Finally arrived about an hour before Andrew who was travelling here by train after a days work in
London.</p>

<p>I checked in, had a walk by the river, then armed with a glass of red wine sat outside to await his
arrival. Had planned an afternoon of wandering around Canterbury – but hey ho that didn&rsquo;t happen
We ate at the pub as the menu looked great ­ nice dinner here, but we&rsquo;ve had better in Canterbury.
Went for a walk after dinner &amp; a drink in town then headed back for an early night as we are
driving to Amsterdam tomorrow.</p>

<h1 id="saturday-23rd-april">Saturday 23rd April</h1>

<p>Lovely full English breakfast about 7.30am this morning &amp; off to Dover to catch the ferry.
Managed to get on the 10am crossing to Dunkirk, brilliant crossing – very windy but bright day.
2 hours on the ferry, then a 3 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hour drive to Amsterdam.
We checked in to the Ink hotel, dumped the luggage &amp; went straight out for a walk &amp; to find
somewhere nice for a drink &amp; relax after our journey.</p>

<p>At the Pancake House we had a lovely bacon, cheese &amp; spinach pancake for lunch.
It&rsquo;s really really cold here, just like home Spring is still waiting to Sprung!!
Later we had a lovely dinner at St. George Argentijns Grill – calamari, steak &amp; wine, all yummy.
Early to bed again as it&rsquo;s Keukenhof in the morning!!</p>

<h1 id="sunday-24th-april">Sunday 24th April</h1>

<p>After a coffee we set off nice &amp; early to the wonderful Keukenhof Gardens to wander around this
stunning place and to see the tulip fields of course – our main reason for this trip.
Just arrived when Andrew had to stop as he has stomachache. Thought I&rsquo;d have to take him back to
the hotel, but eventually he recovered enough to continue, so we went for a cuppa &amp; rested a bit
more.</p>

<p>Explored the whole garden, the inside orchid area and the tulip fields, this is one of the most
beautiful gardens I&rsquo;ve even seen, stunning displays everywhere you look. I would recommend
anyone who loves flowers to visit, there are no words to adequately describe it.</p>

<p>Eventually, having seen everything, we set off back to Amsterdam, parked underground again &amp;
went for a stroll around the shopping centre Plaza – used to be the post office, it&rsquo;s a fabulous old
building that looks like it should be a 5* hotel. Walked next down by the canal and had
a beer sitting outside a cafe, a sudden torrential downpour put an end to that idea!</p>

<p>Strolling on after the rain had stopped we inadvertently found the red light district &amp; wandered
passed a few ladies of the night displaying themselves in the windows, several topless clubs, sex
museums etc etc.
Found the Grasshopper pub with outdoor seating surrounded by flowers &amp; heaters and overlooking
the canal. We ordered a hot chocolate each, very disappointing instant watery thing, we were not
impressed!</p>

<p>Back at the hotel we freshened up &amp; went back out to find some dinner. Strangely we found
Bagels Sandwich Village where we had excellent Tapas &amp; a really good Rioja to go with it. Went
into a cafe for a drink on way back &amp; had fabulous custard chocolate eclairs for pudding, they
really can do cakes over here. Had a bit of trouble getting Andrew back to the hotel room though!</p>

<h1 id="monday-25th-april">Monday 25th April</h1>

<p>Time to check out &amp; it&rsquo;s the long drive back to Dunkirk, ferry back to Dover &amp; the drive back
home from there!
Home to our gorgeous cats, who had definitely missed us, cuddles &amp; fuss then off to Cafe Balti for
a curry &amp; relax after the journey!</p>
