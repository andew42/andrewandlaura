<p>Visiting Jackie in Mojacar</p>

<h1 id="monday-8th-september">Monday 8th September</h1>

<p>Up at 2.20am as couldn&rsquo;t sleep, arrived at Birmingham airport at 5.05am, coffee then check in. Huge queue in departures so no time for coffee, water shopping etc!!!</p>

<p>Arrived at Almeria, collected case &amp; with Jackie about 11.20am - a good flight though we left about 40 mins late arrived only 20mins late.</p>

<p>Keith Jackie&rsquo;s friend drove us to Mojacar where I checked in &amp; changed before we went out for lunch. It&rsquo;s 35%C and very humid. We went for a coffee &amp; water at a cafe by the sea, then walked by the sea to a cafe for a leisurely lunch &amp; long chat. Walked back to the hotel for iced coffee on the terrace &amp; more chatting before Jackie left me about 5ish to get ready for work tonight. I decided on a quiet evening here by the sea &amp; early night as I was up so early &amp; shattered from the heat too.</p>

<p>Sitting on my balcony overlooking the sea &amp; beginning this diary before a long soak in the bath. Went down to the terrace cafe for a glass of wine overlooking the sea, decided to eat here as it was quieter &amp; 3 course dinner in restaurant, had tortilla de patatas with more wine.</p>

<p>Sorted yummy dinner and took another vino tinto to my balcony for a last cig then bed at 10pm</p>

<h1 id="tuesday-9th-september">Tuesday 9th September</h1>

<p>Coffee on roof terrace then met Jac at reception, having checked out. Coffee &amp; oj waiting for bus to village at Masko cafe.</p>

<p>Bus up to the village from the playa was only 5 minutes. Jackie&rsquo;s apartment is lovely - up the hill then down 4 steep flights of stairs from the bus stop. It&rsquo;s a gorgeous flat with a lovely terrace overlooking the valley and the sea. Met the cats Jasmine &amp; Javier sister &amp; brother, both very friendly, especially Jazzy who has enormous beautiful blue eyes. Later we had lunch at Bar Irene next door to Just Jackie&rsquo;s. Sitting on the terrace here before going exploring as Jackie is working from 2 - 7pm today.</p>

<p>Had quite a wander though lots of shops are closed for siesta then went back to Just Jackie&rsquo;s &amp; met a few of the locals before heading back to Jackie&rsquo;s for a rest &amp; got ready for our evening out. Cuddled to cats &amp; read for a while. Both cats were in my bedroom when I returned, Javi has decided that my suitcase is his new bed!</p>

<p>We went out about 8.30 to Stuart &amp; Sharon&rsquo;s restaurant opposite Just Jackie&rsquo;s called El Antler for fab steak dinner on the terrace, met the owners who are really nice then went to Just Jackie&rsquo;s so that I could meet Conny who works for Jackie from there to another bar then up the hill to Toni &amp; Georges bar where Conny joined us later, she&rsquo;s really nice &amp; Toni is hilarious. We went to Pavana with Conny for a last drink on the way home, then Jackie &amp; I sat chatting till about 3.30am!</p>

<h1 id="wednesday-10th-september">Wednesday 10th September</h1>

<p>Up about 9ish &amp; rather hungover, how I managed 4 steep flights of stairs down to Jac&rsquo;s flat without breaking my neck I really don&rsquo;t know! We eventually got ready to go to the playa for lunch at the Chinese, dumplings, seaweed, crispy duck &amp; garlic prawns - all fab &amp; took doggy bag home! Opted for a lazy night in &amp; watched 2 films, Last Orders &amp; the Death at a Funeral - which was hilarious! Relatively early night after last night.</p>

<p>Javi came to bed with me, he&rsquo;s been on my case most of the day.</p>

<h1 id="thursday-11th-september">Thursday 11th September</h1>

<p>Went to sleep with Javi cuddled up against my legs &amp; he doesn&rsquo;t seem to have moved all night till I got up at 8ish. Fed both cats, had coffee, bath etc. Jackie &amp; I then went out to Pavana for coffee then got bus to the playa &amp; went to the supermarket, had a coffee &amp; oj a wander round the shops &amp; bus back as Jackie&rsquo;s opening up at 2pm.</p>

<p>Had some water &amp; met Lisa another of Jackie&rsquo;s friends before coming back to the flat to drop off shopping, eat rest of yesterdays Chinese for late lunch &amp; relax for a while.</p>

<p>Watered the plants, sitting listening to music on my little speaker with Javi snuggled up with me writing this diary. It&rsquo;s 38C again today with a really hot wind blowing too - the heat is tremendous &amp; I&rsquo;ve not much energy! Jac says she&rsquo;s never known it this hot in September in 13 years she&rsquo;s lived here!</p>

<p>Went out for a wander about 7.45pm, watched the sun set over the mountains having zumo naranja at the terrace cafe in the square. Did a bit of shopping, t shirts &amp; earrings &amp; general wander. Arrived at Just Jackie&rsquo;s around 9pm &amp; had a fab chicken curry tapas &amp; tomato juice. Lisa arrived so I stayed &amp; chatted while Jac worked. Conny &amp; her partner turned up later so we all sat around chatting till gone 2am again!</p>

<p>Back to the flat an eventually to bed around 3am!</p>

<h1 id="friday-12th-september">Friday 12th September</h1>

<p>Up at 8am &amp; showered, dressed &amp; ready to catch 9.15 bus down to playa for our 10am hair appts.</p>

<p>Hair all washed &amp; straightened, we went to a beach bar for coffee &amp; oj before catching to bus back to the village. Washing up to date &amp; cats &amp; I sweltering in heat - it&rsquo;s 38c here today!</p>

<p>We relaxed back at the flat for a while before going out to the Pulcinella restaurant which has the highest terrace in Mojacar. Watched the sun setting over the mountains while drinking a glass of wine - beautiful. Had a salad &amp; spinach &amp; pine nut pasta for dinner then went up to the Sarten bar to see Toni &amp; Chris for a drink, met Val there who is lovely, Conny &amp; joined us when she&rsquo;d closed Jackie&rsquo;s another lovely fun evening, down to Pavana for a last drink before home &amp; chatting till 3.30am again.</p>

<h1 id="saturday-13th-september">Saturday 13th September</h1>

<p>Went down to the beach and sat at the Bar la Cometa, had coffee &amp; ordered paella for lunch it was burnt so sent it back &amp; had calamari instead. Wandered by the beach then back to flat 40C today with the Sirocco hot wind again. Had cold bath &amp; relaxed for a while before visiting Martha, lovely Irish lady who has a lovely house &amp; gorgeous roof terrace. Went to  Casa Minguito restaurant which has a gorgeous terrace area with trees &amp; lights etc. ordered a fish platter for 3 which was inedible â€“ won&rsquo;t be eating there again!!</p>

<p>So not much luck with food today. Lisa &amp; Conny joined us &amp; Geraldine came over too,&amp; we all went to Jazz Club - really nice bar another great evening out!</p>

<h1 id="sunday-14th-september">Sunday 14th September</h1>

<p>Slept in till 10.30 think all these 3am + nights out are catching up with me!</p>

<p>We went to beach again &amp; had fab lunch at Tito&rsquo;s later peter Sarstedt&rsquo;s brother Clive was playing - sounded great. Back to village about 6pm as Jackie is working this evening. I went for a wander &amp; found Indalo earrings! Been looking for some that I like since I got here! Bought cigs to take home then went back to flat. Met Jac on way - she heard this morning that her friend Dag had a heart attack this morning &amp; someone had just phoned to tell her he&rsquo;d died - terrible! Sat with Javi on terrace catching up on diary - now off to Just Jackie&rsquo;s for butter chicken curry for dinner &amp; spend last evening up there chatting when she&rsquo;s not serving! Really going to miss her!</p>

<p>Fab buttered chicken curry &amp; lovely wine while Jac is working. The usual late night followed.</p>

<h1 id="monday-15th-september">Monday 15th September</h1>

<p>Up early &amp; coffee &amp; last cuddle with the cats before meeting Keith for the trip back to Almeria airport. Glad to be going home to Andrew &amp; our cats, but will miss Jac &amp; her cats very much too. Been a marvellous weeks holiday &amp; will bring Andrew with me next time!</p>
